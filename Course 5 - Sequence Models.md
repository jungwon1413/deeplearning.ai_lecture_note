### 2주차 (Week 2)
#### Natural Language Processing & Word Embeddings
- Video: Word Representation
	- Word Representation
		- 1-hot representation
			- Ex) I want a glass of orange juice.
			- Ex) I want a glass of apple juice.
	- Featurized representation: word embedding
	- Visualizing word embeddings
		- 300D → 2D (t-SNE)
- Video: Using Word Embeddings
	- Named entity recognition example
		- [Sally] [Johnson] [is] [an] [orange] [farmer]
		- [Robert] [Lin] [is] [an] [apple] [farmer]
	- Transfer learning and word embeddings
		- Learn word embeddings from large text corpus. (1-100B words)<br>(Or download pre-trained embedding online.)
		- Transfer embedding to new task with smaller training set.<br>(Say, 100k words)
		- Optional: Continue to finetune the word embeddings with new data.
	- Relation to face encoding
- Video: Properties of word embeddings
	- Analogies
		- Man → Woman is King → Queen?
	- Analogies using word vectors
		- e_man - e_woman ≒ e_king - e_?
		- Find word w: argmax_w sim(e_w, e_king - e_man + e_woman)
			- e_man - e_woman ≒ e_king - e_w
			- e_king - e_man + e_woman: 30\~75%
	- Cosine Similarity
		- Sim(e_w, e_king - e_man + e_woman)
			- Sim(u, v) = (u.T * v) / (L2norm.u * L2norm.v)
			- Ex) Man : Woman as Boy : Girl
			- Ex2) Ottawa : Canada as Nairobi : Kenya
			- Ex3) Big : Bigger as Tall : Taller
			- Ex4) Yen : Japan as Ruble : Russia
- Video: Embedding matrix
	- Embedding matrix
		- In practice, use specialized function to look up an embedding.
- Video: Learning word embeddings
	- Neural language model
	- Other context/target pairs
		- Ex) I want a glass of orange juice to go along with my cereal.
		- A glass of orange: context
			- Last 4 words
			- 4 words on left & right
			- Last 1 word
			- Nearby 1 word
			- Skipgram
		- Juice: target
- Video: Word2Vec
	- Skipgrams
		- Ex) I want a glass of orange juice to go along with my cereal.
			- Context
				- orange
			- Target
				- Juice
				- Glass
				- My
				- …
	- Model
		- Vocab size = 10,000k
		- Context c ("orange") [6257] → Target t ("juice") [4834]
			- X → Y
		- O_c → E → e_c → O(softmax) → y_hat
	- Problems with softmax classification
		- Hierarchical softmax
		- How to xample the context c?
			- The, of, a, and, to, …
			- Orange, apple, durian, ... 
- Video: Negative Sampling
	- Defining a new learning problem
		- Ex) I want a glass of orange juice to go along with my cereal.
		- Context	Word	Target
		Orange	Juice	1
		Orange	King	0
		Orange	Book	0
		Orange	The	0
		Orange	Of	0
		- K = 5\~20 for smaller datasets
		- K = 2\~5 for large dataset
	- Model
	- Selecting negative examples
- Video: GloVe word vectors
	- Ex) I want a glass of orange juice to go along with my cereal.
		- c, t
		- X_ij = # times i (=t) appears in context of j (=c).
		- X_ij = X_ji
	- Model
	- A note on the featurization view of word embeddings
- Video: Sentiment Classifications
	- Sentiment classification problem
		- Example (X → Y)
			- The dessert is excellent. ★★★★☆
			- Service was quite low. ★★☆☆☆
			- Good for a quick meal, but nothing special. ★★★☆☆
			- Completely lacking in good taste, good service, and good ambience. ★☆☆☆☆
			- 10,000 → 100,000 words
	- Simple sentiment classification model
		- The dessert is excellent. ★★★★☆
			- [8928] [2468] [4694] [3180]
			- The
				- o_8928 → E → e_8928
			- Desert
				- o_2468 → E → e_2468
			- Is
				- o_4694 → E → e_4694
			- Excellent
				- o_3180 → E → e_3180
			- Average all up (300D) → O(softmax) (1\~5) → y_hat
			- This model will have bad result with following sentence:
				- Completely lacking in good taste, good service, and good ambience.
				- Because the sentence contains 3 'good' words, it will have positive prediction.
	- RNN for sentiment classification
		- Many-to-One
		- "not good"
- Video: Debiasing word embeddings
	- The problem of bias in word embeddings
		- Man : Woman as King : Queen
		- Man : Computer_Programmer as Woman : Homemaker (X)
		- Father : Doctor as Mother : Nurse (X)
		- Word embeddings can reflect gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, and other biases of the text used to train the model.
	- Addressing bias in word embeddings
		- Identify bias direction.
			- e_he - e_she
			- e_male - e_female
			- …
			- Average all up
		- Neutralize: For every word that is not definitional, project to get rid of bias.
		- Equalize pairs.
