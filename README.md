#### Neural Networks Basics
- Video: Binary Classification
	- Binary Classification
		- 1 (cat) vs 0 (non cat)
		- Red, Green, and Blue
			- 64 x 64 x 3 = 12,288
			- N = N_x = 12,288
			- X → Y
	- Notation
		- M_train
		- M_test
		- X.shape
		- R_nx x m
- Video: Logistic Regression
	- Logistic Regression
		- Given x, want y_hat = P(y=1 | x)
			- X∈R^nx^, 0 ≤ y_hat ≤ 1
			- Parameters: w∈R_nx, b∈R(real number)
			- Output: y_hat = sigmoid(w^T·x + b)
		- Sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
			- If z large, sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1+0) = 1
			- If z large negative number,<br> sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) ≒ 1 / (1+Big_num) ≒ 0
- Video: Logistic Regression Cost Function
	- Logistic Regression cost function
		- y_hat = sigmoid(w^T·xi + b), where sigmoid(z_i) = 1 / (1 + e^-z_i))
		- Given {(x1, y1), …, (x_m, y_m)}, want  y_hat(i) ≒ yi
		- Loss (error) function:
			- L(y_hat, y) = 1/2·(y_hat - y)^2
			- L(y_hat, y) = -(y log(y_hat) + (1-y) log(1 - y_hat))
				- If y=1: L(y_hat, y) = - log(y_hat)
					- Want log(y_hat) large, want y_hat large.
				- If y=0: L(y_hat, y) = -log(1 - y_hat)
					- Want log(1 - y_hat) … want y_hat small.
		- Cost function:
			- J(w, b) = (1/m) ∑[1∽m](L(y_hat(i), yi)
			- = -(1/m) ∑[1∽m]((yi·log(y_hat(i)) + (1-yi)log(1 - y_hat(i))))
- Video: Gradient Descent
	- Gradient Descent
		- Recap: y_hat = sigmoid(w^T·xi + b), sigmoid(z_i) = 1 / (1 + e^-z_i)
		- J(w, b) = (1/m) ∑[1∽m](L(y_hat(i), yi) = -(1/m) ∑[1∽m]((yi·log(y_hat(i)) + (1-yi)log(1 - y_hat(i))))
		- Want to find w, b, that minimize J(w, b)
		- w := w - alpha·(dJ(w) / dw)
			- Alpha: learning rate
			- dJ(w) / dw: "dw"
			- Same as… w := w - alpha·dw
		- J(w, b)
			- w := w - alpha·(dJ(w, b) / dw)
			- b := b - alpha·(DJ(w, b) / db)
		- ∂: "partial derivative"<br>d: J
- Video: Derivatives
	- Intuition about derivatives
		- Ex) f(a) = 3a
			- If a = 2, f(a) = 6
			- If a = 2.001, f(a) = 6.003
		- Slope (derivative) of f(a) at a = 2 is 3
			- Slope: height/width
				- 0.003 / 0.001
			- If a = 5, f(a) = 15
			- If a = 5.001, f(a) = 15.003
			- Slope at a = 5 is also 3
- Video: More Derivative Examples
	- Ex) f(a) = a^2
		- If a = 2, f(a) = 4
		- If a = 2.001, f(a) ≒ 4.004 (4.004001)
		- Slope (derivative) of f(a) at a = 2 is 4.
		- (d/da)f(a) = 4 when a = 2
		- If a = 5, f(a) = 25
		- If a = 25, f(a) ≒ 25.010
		- (d/da)f(a) = 10 when a = 5
		- (d/da)f(a) = (d/da) a^2 = 2a
		- (d/da) a^2 = 2a
			- (2a) x 0.001
	- If f(a) = a^2, then (d/da) f(a) = 2a
		- If a = 2, (d/da) f(a) = 4
	- If f(a) = a^3, then (d/da) f(a) = 3a^2
		- If a = 2, (d/da) f(a) = 12
	- If f(a) = log_e(a), then (d/da) f(a) = 1/a
		- If a = 2, (d/da) f(a) = 1/2
- Video: Computation Graph
	- Computation Graph
		- Ex) J(a, b, c) = 3(a + bc)
			- u = bc
			- v = a + bc
				- v = a + u
			- J = 3(a + bc)
				- J = 3v
			- 3(a + bc) = 3(5 + 3x2) = 33
- Video: Derivatives with a Computation Graph
	- Computing derivatives
		- (From previous video) J = 3v
			- v = a + u
			- u = bc
			- a = 5, b = 3, c = 2
		- dJ/dv = ? = 3
			- f(a) = 3a
				- df(a)/da = df/da = 3
			- J = 3v
				- dJ/dv = 3
		- dJ/da = 3 = dJ/dv·dv/da
			- dv/da = 1
			- 3 = 3 x 1
		- J → dJ/dv → dJ/da = "da" = 3
		- d(FindOutputVar)/d(Var)
		- u = bc
			- du = 3
			- dJ/du = 3 = dJ/dv·dv/du = 3·1
			- dJ/db = dJ/du·du/db = 2 = 6
				- dJ/du = 3
				- du/db = 2
			- dJ/dc = dJ/du·du/dc = 9
				- dJ/du = 3
				- du/dc = 3
		- From above, "da" = 3, "db" = 6, "dc" = 9
- Video: Logistic Regression Gradient Descent
	- Logistic regression recap
		- Z = wTx + b
		- y_hat = a = sigmoid(z)
		- L(a, y) = -(y log(a) + (1 - y) log(1 - a))
		- For x1, w1, x2, w2, b
			- Z = w1·x1 + w2·x2 + b → y_hat = a = sigmoid(z) → L(a, y)
	- Logistic regression derivatives
		- L(a, y)<br>→ dL(a, y)/da<br>= "da"<br>= -y/a + (1-y)/(1-a)<br>→ "dz"<br>= dL/dz<br>= dL(a, y)/dz<br>= a - y<br>= dL/da·da/dz<br>= dL/da·a(1-a)
		- ∂L/∂w1 = "dw1" = x1·dz
		- dw2 = x2·dz
		- db = dz
		- In result,
			- w1 := w1 - alpha·dw1
			- w2 := w2 - alpha·dw2
			- b := b - alpha·db

	- What is vectorization?
		- Non-vectorized:
			- z = 0<br> for i in range(n - x):<br> z +=  w[i]·x[i]<br> z += b
		- Vectorized:
			- z = np.dot(w, x) + b
			- np.dot(w, x): w.T·x
	- Examples in practice
		- A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
			- Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]
		- Vectorized version vs. for loop
			- Vectorized version: 1.5027… ms
			- For loop: 474.2951… ms
	- GPU/CPU - SIMD: Single Instruction Multiple Data
- Video: More Vectorization Examples
	- Neural network programming guideline
		- Whenever possible, avoid explicit for-loops.
			- Bad example
				- u = Av<br> ui = ∑(Ai·v)
				- u = np.zeros((n, 1))<br> for i …:<br> for j …: <br> u[i] += A[i][j]·v[j]
			- Good example
				- u = np.dot(A, v)
	- Vectors and matrix valued functions
		- Say you need to apply the exponential operation on every element of a matrix/vector.
			- u = np.zeros((n, 1))<br>for i in range(n):<br> u[i] = math.exp(v[i])
			- Calculation examples

			- a(1) = sigmoid(z(3))
		- Vectorized calculation

	- Neural Network Representation
		- Single Neural Network (1 neuron)
			- z = w^T·x + b
			- a = sigmoid(z)
		- Multi Neural Network (many neurons)
			- 1st cell
				- z1[1] = w1[1]^T·x + b1[1]
				- a1[1] = sigmoid(z1[1])
			- 2nd cell
				- z2[1] = w2[1]^T·x + b2[1]
				- a2[1] = sigmoid(z2[1])
			- And so on (for rest of the remaining cells)
			- W[1] = [w1[1], w2[1], w3[1], ...]
			- X = [x1, x2, x3, ...]
			- b[1] = [b1[1], b2[1], b3[1], ...]
			- Then we need to calculate z[1]

			- To sum up

			- a[1] = [a1[1], a2[1], a3[1], ...]
				- = sigmoid(z[1])
	- Neural Network Representation learning

				- (4,1) = (4,3)·(3,1) + (4,1)
			- a[1] = sigmoid(z[1])
				- (4,1) = (4,1)
			- z[2] = W[2]·a[1] + b[2]
				- (1,1) = (1,4)·(4,1) + (1,1)
			- a[2] = sigmoid(z[2])

- Video: Vectorizing across multiple examples
	- Vectorizing across multiple examples
		- From previous lecture...
			- z[1] = w[1]·x + b[1]
			- a[1] = sigmoid(z[1])
			- z[2] = W[2]·a[1] + b[2]
			- a[2] = sigmoid(z[2])
		- x → a[2] = y_hat
		- x(1) → a[2]\(1) = y_hat(1)
		- x(2) → a[2]\(2) = y_hat(2)
		- x(3) → a[2]\(3) = y_hat(3)
		- And so on... until,
		- x(m) → a[2]\(m) = y_hat(m)
			- a[2]\(i)
				- [2]: layer 2
				- (i): example i
		- We can compute values by this way:
			- for i = to m:
				- z[1]\(i) = w[1]·x(i) + b[1]
				- a[1]\(i) = sigmoid(z[1]\(i))
				- z[2]\(i) = W[2]·a[1]\(i) + b[2]
				- a[2]\(i) = sigmoid(z[2]\(i))
		- X = [x(1), x(2), x(3), ..., x(m)] \(and it has (nx, m) shape)
		- Then we can use vectorized method
			- z[1] = W[1]·X + b[1]
				- z[1] = [z[1]\(1), z[1]\(2), z[1]\(3), ..., z[1]\(m)]
				- Shape: (training examples, hidden units)
			- A[1] = sigmoid(z[1])
				- A[1] = [a[1]\(1), a[1]\(2), a[1]\(3), ..., a[1]\(m)]
				- Shape: (training examples, hidden units)
			- z[2] = W[2]·A[1] + b[2]
			- A[2] = sigmoid(z[2])
- Video: Explanation for Vectorized Implementation
	- Justification for vectorized implementation
		- Example
			- z[1]\(1) = w[1]·x(1) + ~b[1]~ 0 (Just to simplify the calculation)
			- z[1]\(2) = w[1]·x(2) + ~b[1]~ 0 (Same as above)
			- z[1]\(3) = w[1]·x(3) + ~b[1]~ 0 (Same as above)
			- w[1]·x(1): Will have (training examples, 1) shape (1st column or feature)
			- w[1]·x(2): Will have (training examples, 1) shape (2nd column or feature)
			- w[1]·x(3): Will have (training examples, 1) shape (3rd column or feature)
			- Then, it can be expressed as following:
				- W[1]·X = W[1]·[x(1), x(2), x(3), ...] \(training examples)
				<br>= [z[1]\(1), z[1]\(2), z[1]\(3), ..., z[1]\(m)]
				<br>= z[1]
				- So, z[1] = W[1]·X + b[1]
	- Recap of vectorizing across multiple examples
		- 1st method (non-vectorized)
			- for i=1 to m:
				- z[1]\(i) = w[1]·x(i) + b[1]
				- a[1]\(i) = sigmoid(z[1]\(i))
				- z[2]\(i) = W[2]·a[1]\(i) + b[2]
				- a[2]\(i) = sigmoid(z[2]\(i))
		- 2nd method (vectorized)
			- z[1] = W[1]·X + b[1]
				- X: A[0] \(since x = a[0])
				- same as W[1]·A[0] + b[1]
			- a[1] = sigmoid(z[1])
			- z[2] = W[2]·A[1]) + b[2]
			- a[2] = sigmoid(z[2])
- Video: Activation Functions
	- Activation functions
		- From previous lecture ... (with some fixes)
			- z[1] = W[1]·X + b[1]
			- a[1] = ~sigmoid(z[1])~ g(z[1])
				- where 'g' can be non-linear function
			- z[2] = W[2]·A[1]) + b[2]
			- a[2] = ~sigmoid(z[2])~ g(z[2])
		- Different kinds of non-linear function
			- sigmoid function:
				- a = 1 / (a + e^-2)
				- This goes between 0 and 1
				- Centered at 0.5
			- tanh function:
				- a = tanh(z)
				<br> (e^z - e^-z) / (e^z + e^-z)
				- This goes between -1 and 1
				- Centered at 0
				- Almost always works better than sigmoid function
			- ReLU function:
				- a = max(0, z)
				- ReLU: Rectified Linear Unit
			- Leaky ReLU function:
				- -0.x if less than 0, z if equal or greater than 0
				- Common multiplier for negatives are 0.01
		- There's various ways to use activation functions
			- Examples
			    - Use tanh for hidden Layers
			    - Use sigmoid for output layer
			    	- You want results to be within y∈{0, 1} range
	- Pros and cons of activation functions
- Video: Why do you need non-linear activation functions?
	- Activation function
		- Recall from last lecture,
			- z[1] = W[1]·X + b[1]
			- a[1] = ~g[1]\(z[1])~ z[1]
				- g(z) = z
				- It's "linear activation function"
			- z[2] = W[2]·A[1]) + b[2]
			- a[2] = ~g[2]\(z[2])~ z[2]
		- Linear function calculation
			- a[1] = z[1] = W[1]·X + b[1]
			- a[2] = z[2] = W[2]·a[1] + b[2]
			<br>= W[2]·(W[1]·X + b[1]) + b[2] where (W[1]·X + b) = a[1]
			- (W[2]·W[1])·X + (W[2]·b[1] + b[2])
				- W[2]·W[1] = W'
				- W[2]·b[1] + b[2] = b'
			- = W'·X + b
			<br> where g(z) = z
			- It's just a linear calculation, without any significant purpose.
- Video: Derivatives of activation functions
	- Sigmoid activation function
		- d/dz·g(z): slope of ~g(x)~ g(z) at z
		<br>= 1/(1 + e^-z) \* (1 - 1/(1 + e^-z))
		<br>= g(z)(1 - g(z))
		<br>= g'(z)
		- Therefore, g'(z) = a·(1 - a)
		- Some examples
			- z=10, g(z)≒1
				- d/dz·g(z) ≒ 1(1 - 1) ≒ 0

			- Thus, it's same as having 1 neuron
	- Random initialization
		- W[1] = np.random.randn((2,2)) \* 0.01
			- Generates 'gaussian random variable'
			- 0.01 is multiplied to produce very small number to initiate
				- Why not 100?
					- This will result sigmoid/tanh function to be extremely large value
					- Having large value weight will result slow learning rate
				- Sometimes, there can be better value than 0.01
					- However, if you train very DEEP neural network, you might want to change this value
				- However, 0.01 will probably work OK
		- b[1] = np.zeros((2,1))
			- b does not have the symmetry problem
		- W[2] = np.random.randn((1,2)) \* 0.01

		- y = x1 XOR x2 XOR x3 XOR ... XOR xn
			- O(log n)
		- You can compute anything with a "single" layer,
