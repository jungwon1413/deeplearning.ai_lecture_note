#### Neural Networks Basics
- Video: Binary Classification
	- Binary Classification
		- 1 (cat) vs 0 (non cat)
		- Red, Green, and Blue
			- 64 x 64 x 3 = 12,288
			- N = N_x = 12,288
			- X → Y
	- Notation
		- M_train
		- M_test
		- X.shape
		- R_nx x m
- Video: Logistic Regression
	- Logistic Regression
		- Given x, want y_hat = P(y=1 | x)
			- X∈R^nx^, 0 ≤ y_hat ≤ 1
			- Parameters: w∈R_nx, b∈R(real number)
			- Output: y_hat = sigmoid(w^T·x + b)
		- Sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
			- If z large, sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1+0) = 1
			- If z large negative number,<br> sigmoid(z) = 1 / (1 + e^(-z)) ≒ 1 / (1+Big_num) ≒ 0
- Video: Logistic Regression Cost Function
	- Logistic Regression cost function
		- y_hat = sigmoid(w^T·x_i + b), where sigmoid(z_i) = 1 / (1 + e^-z_i))
		- Given {(x_1, y_1), …, (x_m, y_m)}, want  y_hat_i ≒ y_i
		- Loss (error) function:
			- L(y_hat, y) = 1/2·(y_hat - y)^2
			- L(y_hat, y) = -(y log(y_hat) + (1-y) log(1 - y_hat))
				- If y=1: L(y_hat, y) = - log(y_hat)
					- Want log(y_hat) large, want y_hat large.
				- If y=0: L(y_hat, y) = -log(1 - y_hat)
					- Want log(1 - y_hat) … want y_hat small.
		- Cost function:
			- J(w, b) = (1/m) ∑[1∽m](L(y_hat_i, y_i)
			- = -(1/m) ∑[1∽m]((y_i·log(y_hat_i) + (1-y_i)log(1 - y_hat_i)))
- Video: Gradient Descent
	- Gradient Descent
		- Recap: y_hat = sigmoid(w^T·x_i + b), sigmoid(z_i) = 1 / (1 + e^-z_i)
		- J(w, b) = (1/m) ∑[1∽m](L(y_hat_i, y_i) = -(1/m) ∑[1∽m]((y_i·log(y_hat_i) + (1-y_i)log(1 - y_hat_i)))
		- Want to find w, b, that minimize J(w, b)
		- w := w - alpha·(dJ(w) / dw)
			- Alpha: learning rate
			- dJ(w) / dw: "dw"
			- Same as… w := w - alpha·dw
		- J(w, b)
			- w := w - alpha·(dJ(w, b) / dw)
			- b := b - alpha·(DJ(w, b) / db)
		- ∂: "partial derivative"<br>d: J
- Video: Derivatives
	- Intuition about derivatives
		- Ex) f(a) = 3a
			- If a = 2, f(a) = 6
			- If a = 2.001, f(a) = 6.003
		- Slope (derivative) of f(a) at a = 2 is 3
			- Slope: height/width
				- 0.003 / 0.001
			- If a = 5, f(a) = 15
			- If a = 5.001, f(a) = 15.003
			- Slope at a = 5 is also 3
- Video: More Derivative Examples
	- Ex) f(a) = a^2
		- If a = 2, f(a) = 4
		- If a = 2.001, f(a) ≒ 4.004 (4.004001)
		- Slope (derivative) of f(a) at a = 2 is 4.
		- (d/da)f(a) = 4 when a = 2
		- If a = 5, f(a) = 25
		- If a = 25, f(a) ≒ 25.010
		- (d/da)f(a) = 10 when a = 5
		- (d/da)f(a) = (d/da) a^2 = 2a
		- (d/da) a^2 = 2a
			- (2a) x 0.001
	- If f(a) = a^2, then (d/da) f(a) = 2a
		- If a = 2, (d/da) f(a) = 4
	- If f(a) = a^3, then (d/da) f(a) = 3a^2
		- If a = 2, (d/da) f(a) = 12
	- If f(a) = log_e(a), then (d/da) f(a) = 1/a
		- If a = 2, (d/da) f(a) = 1/2
- Video: Computation Graph
	- Computation Graph
		- Ex) J(a, b, c) = 3(a + bc)
			- u = bc
			- v = a + bc
				- v = a + u
			- J = 3(a + bc)
				- J = 3v
			- 3(a + bc) = 3(5 + 3x2) = 33
- Video: Derivatives with a Computation Graph
	- Computing derivatives
		- (From previous video) J = 3v
			- v = a + u
			- u = bc
			- a = 5, b = 3, c = 2
		- dJ/dv = ? = 3
			- f(a) = 3a
				- df(a)/da = df/da = 3
			- J = 3v
				- dJ/dv = 3
		- dJ/da = 3 = dJ/dv·dv/da
			- dv/da = 1
			- 3 = 3 x 1
		- J → dJ/dv → dJ/da = "da" = 3
		- d(FindOutputVar)/d(Var)
		- u = bc
			- du = 3
			- dJ/du = 3 = dJ/dv·dv/du = 3·1
			- dJ/db = dJ/du·du/db = 2 = 6
				- dJ/du = 3
				- du/db = 2
			- dJ/dc = dJ/du·du/dc = 9
				- dJ/du = 3
				- du/dc = 3
		- From above, "da" = 3, "db" = 6, "dc" = 9
- Video: Logistic Regression Gradient Descent
	- Logistic regression recap
		- Z = wTx + b
		- y_hat = a = sigmoid(z)
		- L(a, y) = -(y log(a) + (1 - y) log(1 - a))
		- For x_1, w_1, x_2, w_2, b
			- Z = w_1·x_1 + w_2·x_2 + b → y_hat = a = sigmoid(z) → L(a, y)
	- Logistic regression derivatives
		- L(a, y)<br>→ dL(a, y)/da<br>= "da"<br>= -y/a + (1-y)/(1-a)<br>→ "dz"<br>= dL/dz<br>= dL(a, y)/dz<br>= a - y<br>= dL/da·da/dz<br>= dL/da·a(1-a)
		- ∂L/∂w_1 = "dw_1" = x_1·dz
		- dw_2 = x_2·dz
		- db = dz
		- In result,
			- w_1 := w_1 - alpha·dw_1
			- w_2 := w_2 - alpha·dw_2
			- b := b - alpha·db

- Video: Vectorization
	- What is vectorization?
		- Non-vectorized:
			- z = 0<br> for i in range(n - x):<br> z +=  w[i]·x[i]<br> z += b
		- Vectorized:
			- z = np.dot(w, x) + b
			- np.dot(w, x): w.T·x
	- Examples in practice
		- A = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
			- Result: [1, 2, 3, 4]
		- Vectorized version vs. for loop
			- Vectorized version: 1.5027… ms
			- For loop: 474.2951… ms
	- GPU/CPU - SIMD: Single Instruction Multiple Data
- Video: More Vectorization Examples
	- Neural network programming guideline
		- Whenever possible, avoid explicit for-loops.
			- Bad example
				- u = Av<br> ui = ∑(Ai·v)
				- u = np.zeros((n, 1))<br> for i …:<br> for j …: <br> u[i] += A[i][j]·v[j]
			- Good example
				- u = np.dot(A, v)
	- Vectors and matrix valued functions
		- Say you need to apply the exponential operation on every element of a matrix/vector.
			- u = np.zeros((n, 1))<br>for i in range(n):<br> u[i] = math.exp(v[i])
			- Calculation examples
				- import numpy as np
				- u = np.exp(v)
				- np.log(v)
				- np.abs(v)
				- np.maximum(v, 0)
				- v\*\*2
	- Logistic regression derivatives
		- dw = np.zeros((n_x, 1))
		- dw += x_i·dz_i
		- dw /= m
- Video: Vectorizing Logistic Regression
	- Vectorizing Logistic Regression
		- First set
			- z(1) = w^T·x(1) + b
			- a(1) = sigmoid(z(1))
		- Second set
			- z(2) = w^T·x(2) + b
			- a(1) = sigmoid(z(2))
		- Third set
			- z(3) = w^T·x(3) + b
			- a(1) = sigmoid(z(3))
		- Vectorized calculation
			- z = np.dot(w.T, x) + b
				- "broadcasting"
				- [z(1), z(2), ..., z(m)] = w^T·x + [b(1), b(2), ..., b(m)]
			- A = [a(1), a(2), ..., a(m)] = sigmoid(z)

			- dZ = A - Y
			- dw = 1/m·X·dZT
			- db = 1/m·np.sum(dZ)
			- w := w - alpha·dw
			- b := b - alpha·db

			- [59.   239.    155.4    76.9]
		- 100·A/Cal.reshape(1, 4)
			- [[94.91525424    0.          …    ]<br> [   2.03389831    43.51…       ]<br> [ … ]]
			- A / Cal
				- (3, 4) / (1, 4)
	- General Principle
		- (m, n) & [+, -, \*, /]

	- Logistic regression cost function
		- If y = 1: p(y|x) = y_hat
		- If y = 0: p(y|x) = 1 - y_hat
		- To sum up, it's p(y|x)
		- p(y|x) = y_haty (1 - y_hat)(1 - y)
			- If y = 1: p(y|x) = y_hat (1 - y_hat)0
			- If y = 0: p(y|x) = y_hat0 (1 - y_hat)1<br>=  1 x (1 - y_hat) = 1 - y_hat
			- Log p(y|x) = log(y_hat) (1 - y_hat)(1-y)<br>= y log(y_hat) + (1 - y) log(1 - y_hat)<br>= - L(y_hat, y)
	- Cost on m examples
		- log p(labels in training set) = log∏[1∽m]p(y_i|x_i)
		- log p(…) = ∑[1∽m] log p(y_i|x_i)<br>(log p(y_i|x_i) = -L(y_hat_i|y_i) )<br>= -∑[1∽m]L(y_hat_i|y_i)
